2. Scroll down to the section "Manual Driver Download for Windows" and click on the link that says "https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=next%20biometrics%201.1.4.2". This will take you to the Microsoft Update Catalog website where you can find the driver for your scanner.
3. Select the download button that matches your operating system. For Windows 7 32-bit, you should choose the one that says "Next Biometrics - Biometric - 1/29/2020 12:00:00 AM - 1.1.4.2 - Windows 7,Windows 8,Windows 8.1 Drivers (Other Hardware)".
4. A pop-up window will appear asking you to confirm your download. Click on the "Download" button and save the file to your computer.
5. Once the download is complete, locate the file on your computer and double-click on it to run it. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the driver.
6. After the installation is finished, plug in your Biokey 200 fingerprint scanner to a USB port on your computer. The driver should automatically detect and configure it.
7. To use your fingerprint scanner in Windows Hello, go to User Accounts in the Start menu (Windows 10) or Control Panel (Windows 7) and select Sign In Options. Make sure you have a PIN set up, as this will allow you to use your fingerprint as well. Then select to Enroll a Fingerprint and follow the prompts to scan your finger.
8. You can now use your fingerprint or PIN to log in to your Windows system.
