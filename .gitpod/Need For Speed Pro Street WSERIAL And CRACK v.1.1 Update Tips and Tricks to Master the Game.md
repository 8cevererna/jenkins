Here are some tips and tricks that will help you become a pro street racer.
 
## Tuning your car
 
Tuning your car is essential for optimizing its performance and handling. You can tune your car by adjusting its engine, drivetrain, suspension, tires, brakes, nitrous, aerodynamics, and alignment. Each tuning option has a different effect on your car's speed, acceleration, grip, stability, and responsiveness. You can also use the Autosculpt feature to modify your car's body parts and see how they affect its aerodynamics and weight.
 
The best tuning settings depend on the racing mode you are playing. For example, for Drag races, you will want to have a high horsepower engine, a short gear ratio, a stiff suspension, a low tire pressure, a strong nitrous boost, and a low downforce. For Drift races, you will want to have a low horsepower engine, a long gear ratio, a soft suspension, a high tire pressure, a weak nitrous boost, and a high downforce. For Grip races, you will want to have a balanced tuning that suits your driving style and the track conditions. For Speed Challenge races, you will want to have a high top speed engine, a medium gear ratio, a medium suspension, a medium tire pressure, a medium nitrous boost, and a medium downforce.
